# Email Spam Classifier  

Check out the Email Spam Classifier website [here](https://spam-check-b01h.onrender.com/) to experience the power of machine learning in email classification.

This web application uses a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam (ham). It is built using Flask, Bootstrap, and a trained machine learning model.

## Overview

The project consists of a Flask web application that provides a simple user interface for entering email content. The underlying machine learning model, trained on email data, predicts whether the input email is spam or not.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- Flask
- scikit-learn (for the machine learning model)
- Bootstrap (for styling)

## Try it Out

Visit the Email Spam Classifier website [here](https://spam-check-b01h.onrender.com/) to test the spam classification functionality.

Feel free to enter different email content and see how the model classifies them!
